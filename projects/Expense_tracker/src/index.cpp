//Iam actively going to create an expense tracker app in c++ and be the first user of this application before i post it on google play store 

//Okay , lets dive into this shit head on 

//Features to implement in the application 
/*
1. Add a new expense - create a function to handle ADDING 
2. View all expenses - create a function to handle VIEW
3. Summarize expenses by category - create a function to handle CATEGORIZING 
4. Save / load data from a csv file - create save and load functions to handle user information 
5.Export reports to .csv so they can open in excel 
*/

//This project will demonstrate my skills in 
/*
1. File I / O 
2. Classes & structs (Expense Object)
3. Vectors or maps (data structures )
4. Basic algorithms (sorting algorithm for searching for an expense in your records)
5. Clean code and a modular aesthetic new age design kind of thing
